Important:
Before running the program, please make sure that you have already installed OpenCV3 for Java. 
For the implementation of KNN, SVM and logistic regression algorithms by ourselves,
please click “Basic Algorithms Implemented By Ourselves” button:
a. Click “Training Image Process” button to process training images with PCA.
b. Click “Testing Image Process” button to process test images with PCA.
c. Click “KNN” button to run the KNN algorithm, the outputs on the right side are
the errors, the outputs in the Console window are the complete output.
d. Click “SVM Model Training” button to train the SVM models which are saved as
files and can be reused.
e. Click the “SVM” button to run the SVM algorithm.
f. Click the “Logistic Regression Model training” button.
g. Click the “Logistic Regression” button.
3) For& the face recognition system based on&OpenCV. If you want to register new users,
please click “Register Face”. It is required to register 10 images for each new user.Please
remember to retrain your models by clicking “Training” button. If you want to recognize
a user, please click “Recognize Face” button.
