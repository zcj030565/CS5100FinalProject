Before running the program, please make sure that you have already installed OpenCV3 for Java. 
For the implementation of KNN, SVM and logistic regression algorithms coded by ourselves:
a. Please click “Basic Algorithms Implemented By Ourselves” button:
b. Click “Training Image Process” button to process training images with PCA.
c. Click “Testing Image Process” button to process test images with PCA.
d. Click “KNN” button to run KNN algorithm.
The outputs on the right side are errors.The outputs at the Console window are complete output.
e. Click “SVM Model Training” button to train SVM models which are saved as files and can be reused.
f. Click “SVM” button to run SVM algorithm.
g. Click “Logistic Regression Model training” button.
h. Click “Logistic Regression” button.

For the face recognition system based on OpenCV. 
If you want to register new users,please click “Register Face”. It is required to save 10 images for each new user.
Please remember to retrain your models by clicking “Training” button. 
If you want to recognize a user, please click “Recognize Face” button.
