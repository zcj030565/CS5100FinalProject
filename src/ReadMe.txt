Important:
Before running the program, please make sure that you have already installed OpenCV3 for Java. 

There are 4 buttons in the GUI.
if you click on the button "Basic Algorithms Implemented By Ourselves", you will see the KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression implemented 
by ourselves without using any third-party machine learning libraries. 
These algorithms are running on the dataset ORL.

The other 3 buttons are for the face recognition system running on OpenCV and libsvm(a third-party machine learning library for SVM). 
You can register images for new person to enlarge your database if you click on the register button. 
You can ask the system to recognize the person who has already registered in the database. 
For those who has never been registered,they may classified as strangers. 
Every time you register any new faces, please click on the training button to retrain your model,otherwise, it will not make sense.
